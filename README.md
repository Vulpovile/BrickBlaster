# BrickBlaster - A classic brick destruction game!
A classic brick-destroying game! Aim your paddle to bounce the ball against the wall and break each brick, the angle you hit matters!  
Be careful not to miss! You only have 5 balls!  
You can get the Level Builder at https://github.com/Vulpovile/BrickBlaster-LevelBuilder

## THIS SOFTWARE HAS MILDLY OK CODE
Yes I am aware the code for this is not great  
Please do not use it as a reference for how I code in a professional setting.  
I made it quickly because I wondered how easy it would be to make.  
I did not care about any conventions, clean code, or anything.  
It is not very efficient either! (Though, it *will* run on Windows 95+ (And on a PinePhone!!!))  
  
Want to continue? Have Fun!
